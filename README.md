# Wed Visualization Dashboard

We create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from the weather data from the Weatherpy API.

We've created a landing page to act as a homepage that contains our summary and links to each visualization page with a sidebar previewing the images of each plot.

The comparisons page contains the visualization on the same page allowing us to visually compare. We also used a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations

Once we constructed our website, we were able to successfully deploy our website using GitHub pages at https://github.com/amblakemore/blakemore_pages
